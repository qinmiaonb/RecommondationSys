    '''
    Implicit weighted ALS taken from Hu, Koren, and Volinsky 2008. Designed for alternating least squares and implicit
    feedback based collaborative filtering.

    parameters:

    training_set - Our matrix of ratings with shape m x n, where m is the number of users and n is the number of items.
    Should be a sparse csr matrix to save space.

    lambda_val - Used for regularization during alternating least squares. Increasing this value may increase bias
    but decrease variance. Default is 0.1.

    alpha - The parameter associated with the confidence matrix discussed in the paper, where Cui = 1 + alpha*Rui.
    The paper found a default of 40 most effective. Decreasing this will decrease the variability in confidence between
    various ratings.

    iterations - The number of times to alternate between both user feature vector and item feature vector in
    alternating least squares. More iterations will allow better convergence at the cost of increased computation.
    The authors found 10 iterations was sufficient, but more may be required to converge.

    rank_size - The number of latent features in the user/item feature vectors. The paper recommends varying this
    between 20-200. Increasing the number of features may overfit but could reduce bias.

    seed - Set the seed for reproducible results

    The feature vectors for users and items. The dot product of these feature vectors should give you the expected
